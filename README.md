The dataset being used is the sentiment140 dataset which contains 16,00,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets have been annotated (0 = Negative, 4 = Positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment. A comparative study has been done using three different algorithms:

- Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm
- Linear SVM Algorithm
- Logistic Regression Algorithm
